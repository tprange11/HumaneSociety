# HumaneSociety  
Project out of 160 points  

As a developer, I want to produce an application for a humane society that stores and displays data about dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, ferrets, etc. in a database (created using the provided .sql file) by filling out the ‘Query’ class provided in the starter code.

1. - [ ] (**10 points**) As a humane society employee, I want to be able to keep track of and update which room an animal is housed in (each animal will have its own room).  
1. - [ ] (**10 points**) As a humane society employee, I want to be able to update an animal’s status to “adopted” after it becomes adopted, so that it is known exactly what animals have been adopted.

1. - [ ] (**10 points**) As an adopter, I want to be able to create a profile that contains personal information about myself and store it in the database, so that the humane society knows if I am a good fit to adopt an animal.
